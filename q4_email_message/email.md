Hi Bill,

In my attempt to find the top spending users, I had to join the receipts and the users dataset. Throughout the process I discovered that there are ~200 duplicated customer records in the users dataset.

To make sure we're working with an optimized database we would need to clean this up, and to insure data integrity we need to find out how this happened so we can maintain a healthy data pipeline in the future. From a product and customer sign up perspective, are you aware of anything that would prompted this data collection behavior, e.g. in-app forms, reset password? Have there been customer complaints about log in issues recently?

I'm happy to hop on a call to explain my findings and the indication a bit more, please let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Tianchi
